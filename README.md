## Project creation

### wid new

```shell
wid new your-app-name
```

After executing this command, create a [project boilerplate](https://github.com/zhaohuanyuu/boilerplates) according to the prompts. 

If you need to use a custom project boilerplate,project boilerplate, you can specify it through the setting command.

### wid set

- repo [boilerplate-repo-url]

```shell

```

It must be constrained according to the file structure of the [project boilerplate](https://github.com/zhaohuanyuu/boilerplates). Currently there are only two levels (custom configuration will be added in the future)
